            <hr>
            <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;">
you know I want you it's not a secret I try to hide you 
know you want me so don't keep saying a hand are tight
your Clarance not in the Cs and fate is pulling your miles away and outter reach
from me but you're here in my heart so who can stop me a fight aside that you're my
                
destiny what if we reite the Stars say you were made to be
mine nothing can keep us aart you be the one I was meant to fight it's it's up to
you and it's up to me no one can say what we get to be why don't we
reite the Stars maybe the world could be ours tonight
<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more" class="more-content">
you think it's easy you think I don't want to run to
you but there are mountains and there are doors that we
can't walk through I know you're wondering why because we're able to be
just you and me Within These Walls but when we go inside you're going to wake
up and see that it was hopeless after all no no one can reite the Stars how
can you say you'll be mine everything keeps us aart and I'm not the one you
were meant to fight it's not up to you it's not up to me when everyone tells us
what we can be how can we reite the Stars say that the world can be
yours tonight all I want is to fly with you all I want is to
fall with you so just give me all of you it feels
impossible impossible say that is possible no one can reite the Stars how
can you say you will be mine everything keeps us apart and I'm not the one you
were meant to fight it's not up to you it's not up to me when everyone tells us
what we can be how can we reite the Stars say that the world can be
ours tonight
