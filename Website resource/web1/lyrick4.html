I walked through the door with you
The air was cold, but something 'bout it felt like home somehow
Left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you still got it in your drawer, even now
Oh, your sweet disposition, and my wide eyed gaze
We're singing in a car getting lost upstate

Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days
And I know it's long gone and that magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not, fine at all
Cause here we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red cause you were looking over to me
Wind in my hair, I was there,
<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more" class="more-content">
I remember it all too well
Photo album on my counter, your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin size bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on a tee-ball team
You tell me 'bout your past thinking your future was me
Cause here we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all too well

And maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
Till you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there, I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest

I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
Cause I remember it all, all, all too well

Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again
But I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it, cause you remember it all too well, yeah
Cause there we are again when I loved you so

Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well
